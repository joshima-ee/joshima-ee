### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Â Â Â I am an electrical engineer by profession with an interest in data science. In my experience, most people fail to see the power of data and simply store records without any plans for them. I aim to utilize data in my work to make data driven decisions.

Â Â Â I am currently focusing on honing my skills in SQL and the art of data visualizations.
